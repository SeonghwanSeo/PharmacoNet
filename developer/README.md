## Using PharmacoNet's protein representation

Example scripts to use PharmacoNet's protein pharmacophore representation, which depend on `torch-geometric`.

```bash
# construct conda environment; pymol-open-source is not required.
conda create -n pmnet-dev python=3.10 openbabel=3.1.1
conda activate pmnet-dev
# install PharmacoNet & torch_geometric & wandb & tensorboard
pip install -e '.[dev]' --find-links https://data.pyg.org/whl/torch-2.3.1+cu121.html
```

Example datasets (100 or 1,000 pockets) can be available at [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1o8tDCsjIqaPRoJhs5SKW4yi0geA9h_Nv?usp=sharing), which are constructed by CrossDocked2020 and QuickVina 2.1.
